![ProtoCentral MAX30003 Single-channel ECG breakout](docs/images/max30003_brk.jpg)

If you dont already have one, you can buy [ProtoCentral MAX30003 breakout here.](https://www.protocentral.com/open-medical-devices/1149-protocentral-max30003-single-lead-ecg-breakout-board.html)


MAX30003 is a single-lead ECG monitoring IC which has built-in R-R detection and several other features that make it perfect for a wearable single-lead ECG application.  

Several new features on this chip make it ideal for wearable applications. First is the low power consumption - just 85 uW of power and can work from 1.1 V onwards ! Also of interest is the fact that it can work with only two chest electrodes without the need for a third right-leg drive (DRL) electrode.

The best feature of this chip though is the built-in R-R detection algorithm which can measure the time between successive peaks of the QRS complex of the ECG. This means that heart-computation comes right out of the box without any microcontroller-side code requirement. Heart-rate computation just got a lot easier !!

# Wiring the board to your Arduino

If you have bought the breakout the connection with the Arduino board is as follows:

|MAX30003 pin label| Arduino Connection   |Pin Function      |
|----------------- |:--------------------:|-----------------:|
| MISO             | D12                  |  Slave out|             
| MOSI             | D11                  |  Slave in           |
| SCK              | D13                  |  Serial clock     |
| CS0              | D7                   |  Slave select|
| FCLK             | NC                   |  External clock(32KHz)     |

# Running the Arduino Sketch

If you have correctly installed the libraries, the example sketeches should now be available from within Arduino.

[Download the Arduino Sketch here for this board here.](https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_max30003/releases/download/v0.1/protocentral_max30003_arduino.zip)

Open up your Arduino IDE and run the Arudino sketch (.ino) file in the archive that you downloaded. Your Arduino should now be programmed to read the ecg data and sending over the USB-UART.  

# Using the ProtoCentral MAX30003 GUI

The GUI for visulizing the ECG data as well as parameters like R-R interval and Heartrate is written in Processing, based on Java and is cross-compilable across platforms.

Java 8 is required on all platforms for running the processing-based GUI application. You can download Java for your platform from the following link.

[https://java.com/en/download/](https://java.com/en/download/)

## Processing GUI Installation

Download the zip file containing the executable files from the following links for 32-bit/64-bit Windows. If you do not know if you have a 64-bit or 32-bit computer, please download the 32-bit version.

* [Windows 32-bit Executable (ZIP)](https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_max30003/releases/download/v0.1/protocentral_max30003_gui-v0.1-win32.zip)
* [Windows 64-bit Executable (ZIP)](https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_max30003/releases/download/v0.1/protocentral_max30003_gui-v0.1-win64.zip)
* [MacOS Executable (ZIP)](https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_max30003/releases/download/v0.1/protocentral_max30003_gui-v0.1-macOS.zip)
* [Linux 32-bit Executable (ZIP)](https://github.com/Protocentral/protocentral_max30003/releases/download/v0.1/protocentral_max30003_gui-v0.1-linux32.zip)

# Connecting the ECG Electrodes

A 2-electrode cable along with a standard stereo jack is provided along with the shield to connect the electrodes to the board. The electrode input connector is highlighted in the below picture.

The other side of the electrode connector would connect to snap-on electrodes attached to the body. For testing purposes, you can use an ECG simulator to provide inputs to the board.

*Warning:
When connecting the electodes to the body, it is safer to disconnect the mains power source to the Arduino. For example, if  you are using the Arduino along with a laptop, disconnecting the battery charger from the laptop would be a safe option.*
